# DistributedSystems

18-749 Reliable Distributed Systems

The course involved learning about replication, consistency, commercial fault-tolerant architectures, network partitioning, the CAP theorem, and reliability in both enterprise and embedded systems, with case studies surrounding Amazon EC2, Netflix, Therac-25, Three Mile Island, and more. The flagship multi-week project involved the design and implementation of an industry-grade fault-tolerant distributed asynchronous system, with heartbeats, distributed consensus, total ordering, checkpointing, and logging to provide strong consistency for a distributed replicated application. This project involved supporting different replication styles (active, or hot-swap replication, as well as  passive, or primary-backup replication), along with mechanisms to ensure no downtime even as crash faults are injected.
